Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six,
with each player selecting from a roster of over 20 characters,
known in-game as "heroes", each with a unique style of play,
whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense,
Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure
and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across
map in a limited amount of time.
Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about
following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer
online role-playing game Titan. A portion of the Titan team came up with
the concept of Overwatch, based on the success of team-based first-person
shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the growing popularity of multiplayer online
battle arenas, creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork.

Offense: Offense characters have high mobility and are known for their ability 
to deal large amounts of damage. To balance this, offense characters have a low number of hit points.
Defense: Defense characters excel at protecting specific locations and creating choke points.
Some can provide several means of field support, such as sentry turrets and traps.
Tank: Tank characters have many more hit points compared to other characters. They are able to draw
enemy fire away from their teammates to themselves, disrupting the enemy team. Tank heroes have various ways to protect
themselves and their team with shield-like abilities.
Support: Support characters are utility characters that have abilities that enhance their own team or weaken their enemies.
They do not deal a lot of damage, nor do they have many hit points, but the buffs and debuffs they provide aid teammates in eliminating their opponents.
