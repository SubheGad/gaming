<font size="5">
The "Save the World" mode is described as a co-op sandbox survival game<br>
and is about exploration, scavenging items, crafting weapons,<br>
building fortified structures, and fighting waves of encroaching monsters.<br>
Tim Sweeney, Epic's founder, described the game as "Minecraft meets Left 4 Dead".<br>
The game cycles between managing one's resources at a safe home base,<br>
and then going out on missions to complete quests as to collect<br>
resources and obtain rewards to advance the game's story.<br>
In the meta-game, the player has an inventory of weapon and trap schematics,<br>
hero characters, defender characters, and support characters, along with collected resources.<br>
Schematics are used to construct weapons and traps when on the field.<br>
Hero characters represent characters from one of four classes that the player<br>
can use while on mission,(Soldier, Constructor, Ninja and Outlander)<br>
as well as used to undertake resource-gathering missions<br>
making them unavailable to use until they return from the mission.<br>
Defender characters can be summoned to help with defense<br>
but only if there are less than four players on a mission.<br>
