Smite is a free-to-play, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)<br>
video game developed and published by Hi-Rez Studios for Microsoft Windows,<br>
macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In Smite, players control a god, goddess,<br>
or other mythological figure and take part in team based combat, using abilities<br>
and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions.<br>
The game has multiple player versus player modes, many playable characters.<br>
Smite features many different game modes, with the largest being Conquest.<br>
Players are formed into two teams, with five players to each team.<br>
All players begin at opposite sides of a map at their team's 'fountain'.<br>
Before the players enter the map, they are granted an amount of gold<br>
(usually 1,500) to buy starting items. These items grant special<br>
bonuses or abilities that enhance the player's god.<br>
There are three continuous 'lanes' running from one side of the map to the other.<br>
Each lane is defended by a 'Phoenix' which is accompanied by a pair of extra defensive towers.<br>
Phoenixes and towers deal a large amount of damage to any enemies that come too close.<br>
The goal of each game is to destroy the opposing team's Phoenixes and the Titan,<br>
a giant warrior who must be defeated to win the game.<br>
