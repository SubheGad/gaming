The multiplayer introduces a new<br>
momentum based movement system<br>
which utilizes thruster packs to allow <br>
players to perform slow boosts into the air,as well as<br>
perform wall running and sliding,all the while giving players<br>
complete gun control.In addition to the Pick 10 class system from Black Ops II,<br>
Treyarch implemented a character system called "Specialists",where players can pick from 9<br>
different soldiers,each with either a special weapon or ability unique to them.In a later update<br>
a tenth specialist named Blackjack was added to the game.Blackjack is able to mimic the<br>
abilities of other specialists,and is only playable for a short amount of time<br>
upon completing a set of challenges.A new "Gunsmith" feature offers<br>
aestheticvariations in weapon attachments,allowing various weapon<br>
customization combinations.The Paintshop feature allows players<br>
to create their own custom prints onto< specific portions<br>
of a gun,further emphasizing the depth of<br>
customization in the game.<br>
